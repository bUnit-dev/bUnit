# Blazor Components Testing Library

A testing library for Blazor Components. You can easily define components under test in C# or Razor syntax, it has intelligent HTML diffing/comparison logic. You can easily interact with and inspect components, trigger event handlers, provide cascading values, inject services, mock `IJsRuntime`, and perform snapshot testing.

This library's goal is to make it easy to write _comprehensive, stable unit tests_ for Blazor Components/Razor Components. To see how, head to the Wiki pages:
