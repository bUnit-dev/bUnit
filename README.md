# bUnit - a testing library for Blazor components

<a href="https://www.telerik.com/campaigns/blazor/free-trial-1?utm_source=egilhansen&utm_medium=cpm&utm_campaign=blazor-trial-readme-sponsored-message"><img align="right" width="200" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bUnit-dev/bUnit/main/docs/site/sponsors/telerik-ad-github.svg" /></a>

**bUnit** is a testing library for Blazor Components. Its goal is to make it easy to write _comprehensive, stable_ unit tests. With bUnit, you can:

- Setup and define components under tests using C# or Razor syntax
- Verify outcomes using semantic HTML comparer
- Interact with and inspect components as well as trigger event handlers
- Pass parameters, cascading values and inject services into components under test
- Mock `IJSRuntime`, Blazor authentication and authorization, and others

bUnit builds on top of existing unit testing frameworks such as xUnit, NUnit, and MSTest, which run the Blazor component tests in just the same way as any normal unit test. bUnit runs a test in milliseconds, compared to browser-based UI tests which usually take seconds to run.
