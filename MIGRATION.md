# Migration Guide `v1` to `v2`
This document describes the changes that need to be made to migrate from bUnit 1.x to 2.x.

## Removal of `GetChangesSinceFirstRender` and `GetChangesSinceLastRender` methods
The `GetChangesSinceFirstRender` and `GetChangesSinceLastRender` methods have been removed from `IRenderedComponent<TComponent>`. There is no one-to-one replacement for these methods, but the general idea is to select the HTML in question via `Find` and assert against that.

Alternatively, the `IRenderFragment` still offers the `OnMarkupUpdated` event, which can be used to assert against the markup after a render.
