# Migration Guide `v1` to `v2`
This document describes the changes that need to be made to migrate from bUnit 1.x to 2.x.

## Removal of `GetChangesSinceFirstRender` and `GetChangesSinceLastRender` methods
The `GetChangesSinceFirstRender` and `GetChangesSinceLastRender` methods have been removed from `IRenderedComponent<TComponent>`. There is no one-to-one replacement for these methods, but the general idea is to select the HTML in question via `Find` and assert against that.

Alternatively, the `IRenderFragment` still offers the `OnMarkupUpdated` event, which can be used to assert against the markup after a render.

## Removal of `IsNullOrEmpty` extension method on `IEnumerable<T>` and `CreateLogger` on `IserviceProvider`
The `IsNullOrEmpty` extension method on `IEnumerable<T>` has been removed, as well as the `CreateLogger` extension method on `IServiceProvider`. These extension methods are pretty common and conflict with other libraries. These methods can be recreated like this:

```csharp
public static class Extensions
{
    public static bool IsNullOrEmpty<T>(this IEnumerable<T> enumerable)
        => enumerable == null || !enumerable.Any();
    
    public static ILogger<T> CreateLogger<T>(this IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        var loggerFactory = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ILoggerFactory>() ?? NullLoggerFactory.Instance;
        return loggerFactory.CreateLogger<T>();
    }
}
```

## Merge of `bunit.core` and `bunit.web`
The `bunit.core` and `bunit.web` packages have been merged into a single `bunit` package. If you used either of these packages, you should remove them and install the `bunit` package instead.
