# bUnit: a testing library for Blazor components

**bUnit** is a testing library for Blazor Components. Its goal is to make it easy to write _comprehensive, stable_ unit tests. With bUnit, you can:

- Setup and define components under tests using C# or Razor syntax
- Verify outcomes using semantic HTML comparer
- Interact with and inspect components as well as trigger event handlers
- Pass parameters, cascading values and inject services into components under test
- Mock `IJSRuntime`, Blazor authentication and authorization, and others

bUnit builds on top of existing unit testing frameworks such as xUnit, NUnit, and MSTest, which run the Blazor components tests in just the same way as any normal unit test. bUnit runs a test in milliseconds, compared to browser-based UI tests which usually take seconds to run.

**Go to the [Documentation](xref:getting-started) pages to learn more.**

### Test example

Let’s write a test for the `<Counter>` component listed below. This comes with the standard Blazor project template which verifies that the counter corrects increments when the button is clicked:

[!code-razor[Counter.razor](../samples/components/Counter.razor)]

To do this, you can carry out the following using bUnit and xUnit:

[!code-cshtml[CounterTest.razor](../samples/tests/razor/CounterTest.razor)]

This test uses bUnit's test context to render the `Counter` component with the `Render` method. It then finds the button the component rendered and clicks it with the `Find` and `Click` methods. Finally, it finds the paragraph (`<p>`) element and verifies that it matches the expected markup passed to the MarkupMatches method.
