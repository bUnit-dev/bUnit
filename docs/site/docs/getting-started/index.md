# Getting started with bUnit

To start writing tests for Blazor components, first set up a test project and then you can start adding tests.

The *basic* getting started topics are as follows:

1. **<xref:create-test-project>** covers setting up a bUnit test project.
2. **<xref:writing-tests>** covers the basics of writing tests for Blazor components.

The *next level* topics are:

1. **[Providing different types of input](xref:providing-input)** to a component under test, e.g. passing parameters or injecting services.
2. **[Verifying output in various ways](xref:verification)** from a component under test, e.g. inspecting the rendered markup.
3. **[Mocking dependencies](xref:test-doubles)** a component under test has, e.g. the `IJsRuntime` or `HttpClient`.

## Getting help

Can't figure out how to write a test for a testing scenario? Do you have a testing scenario that is hard to write or cannot be written elegantly with bUnit? Have you found a bug in bUnit? Head over to [bUnitâ€™s discussion forum](https://github.com/egil/bUnit/discussions) to ask a question, give feedback, or suggest a new feature. Alternatively, join [bUnits Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/egil/bunit) and let us know. There are no stupid questions - all are welcome!
