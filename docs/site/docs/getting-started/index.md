# Getting started with bUnit

To start writing tests for Blazor components, first set up a test project and then you can start adding tests.

The *basic* getting started topics are as follows:

1. **<xref:create-test-project>** covers setting up a bUnit test project.
2. **<xref:writing-tests>** covers the basics of writing tests for Blazor components.

The *next level* topics are:

1. **[Providing different types of input](xref:providing-input)** to a component under test, e.g. passing parameters or injecting services.
2. **[Verifying output in various ways](xref:verification)** from a component under test, e.g. inspecting the rendered markup.
3. **[Mocking dependencies](xref:test-doubles)** a component under test has, e.g. the `IJsRuntime` or `HttpClient`.

## Introduction video

This video gives an introduction to bUnit, what it is, why its needed, and how to use it. It covers different testing strategies, and how to build maintainable test and maintainable components.

## Getting help

Can't figure out how to write a test for a testing scenario? Do you have a testing scenario that is hard to write or cannot be written elegantly with bUnit? Have you found a bug in bUnit? Head over to [bUnitâ€™s discussion forum](https://github.com/egil/bUnit/discussions) to ask a question, give feedback, or suggest a new feature. Alternatively, join [bUnits Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/egil/bunit) and let us know. There are no stupid questions - all are welcome!
