# Writing Tests in C# for Blazor Components

Testing Blazor components is a little different from testing regular C# classes: Blazor components are *rendered*; they have the *Blazor component life cycle* during which we can *provide input* to them and they can *produce output*.

Use **bUnit** to render the component under test, pass in its parameters, inject required services, and access the rendered component instance and the markup it has produced.

Rendering a component happens through bUnit's <xref:Bunit.TestContext>. The result of the rendering - a <xref:Bunit.IRenderedComponent`1> - provides access to the component instance and the markup produced by the component.

## Creating a Basic Test

This is a simple example that tests the following `<HelloWorld>` component:

[!code-cshtml[HelloWorld.razor](../../../samples/components/HelloWorld.razor)]

# [xUnit](#tab/xunit)

[!code-csharp[HelloWorldTest.cs](../../../samples/tests/xunit/HelloWorldTest.cs)]

# [NUnit](#tab/nunit)

[!code-csharp[HelloWorldTest.cs](../../../samples/tests/nunit/HelloWorldTest.cs)]

> [!NOTE]
> `TestContext` is an ambiguous reference between `TestContext` and `NUnit.Framework.TestContext`, so you have to specify the `Bunit` namespace when referencing `TestContext` to resolve the ambiguity for the compiler. Alternatively, you can give bUnit's `TestContext` a different name during import, e.g.: `using BunitTestContext = Bunit.TestContext;` 

# [MSTest](#tab/mstest)

[!code-csharp[HelloWorldTest.cs](../../../samples/tests/mstest/HelloWorldTest.cs)]

> [!NOTE]
> `TestContext` is an ambiguous reference between `TestContext` and `Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting.TestContext`, so you have to specify the `Bunit` namespace when referencing `TestContext` to resolve the ambiguity for the compiler. Alternatively, you can give bUnit's `TestContext` a different name during import, e.g.:   
> `using BunitTestContext = Bunit.TestContext;` 

***

The test above does the following:

1. Creates a new instance of the disposable bUnit <xref:Bunit.TestContext>, and assigns it to `ctx` variable using the `using var` syntax to avoid unnecessary source code indention.
2. Renders the `<HelloWorld>` component using <xref:Bunit.TestContext>, which is done through the <xref:Bunit.TestContext.RenderComponent``1(Bunit.Rendering.ComponentParameter[])> method. We cover passing parameters to components on the <xref:passing-parameters-to-components> page.
3. Verify the rendered markup from the `<HelloWorld>` component using the `MarkupMatches` method. The `MarkupMatches` method performs a semantic comparison of the expected markup with the rendered markup.

> [!TIP]
> Learn more about how the semantic HTML/markup comparison in bUnit works, and how to customize it on the <xref:semantic-html-comparison> page.

> [!TIP]
> In bUnit tests, we like to use the abbreviation `CUT`, short for "component under test", to indicate the component that is being tested. This is inspired by the common testing abbreviation `SUT`, short for "system under test".

## Remove Boilerplate Code from Tests

We can remove some boilerplate code from each test by making the <xref:Bunit.TestContext> implicitly available to the test class so we do not have to have `using var ctx = new Bunit.TestContext();` in every test. This can be done like this:

# [xUnit](#tab/xunit)

[!code-csharp[HelloWorldImplicitContextTest.cs](../../../samples/tests/xunit/HelloWorldImplicitContextTest.cs)]

Since xUnit instantiates test classes for each execution of test methods inside them and disposes of them after each test method has run, we simply inherit from <xref:Bunit.TestContext>, and methods like <xref:Bunit.TestContext.RenderComponent``1(Bunit.Rendering.ComponentParameter[])> can now be called directly from each test, as seen in the listing above. 

# [NUnit](#tab/nunit)

[!code-csharp[HelloWorldImplicitContextTest.cs](../../../samples/tests/nunit/HelloWorldImplicitContextTest.cs)]

[!code-csharp[BunitTestContext.cs](../../../samples/tests/nunit/BunitTestContext.cs)]

Since NUnit instantiates a test class only once for all tests inside it, we cannot simply inherit directly from <xref:Bunit.TestContext> as we want a fresh instance of <xref:Bunit.TestContext> for each test. Instead, we create a helper class, `BunitTestContext`, which is listed above, and use that to hook into NUnit's `[SetUp]` and `[TearDown]` methods, which runs before and after each test.

Methods like <xref:Bunit.TestContext.RenderComponent``1(Bunit.Rendering.ComponentParameter[])> can then be called directly from each test, as seen in the listing above.

# [MSTest](#tab/mstest)

[!code-csharp[HelloWorldImplicitContextTest.cs](../../../samples/tests/mstest/HelloWorldImplicitContextTest.cs)]

[!code-csharp[BunitTestContext.cs](../../../samples/tests/mstest/BunitTestContext.cs)]

Since MSTest instantiates a test class only once for all tests inside it, we cannot simply inherit directly from <xref:Bunit.TestContext> as we want a fresh instance of <xref:Bunit.TestContext> for each test. Instead, we create a helper class, `BunitTestContext`, which is listed above, and use that to hook into MSTest's `[TestInitialize]` and `[TestCleanup]` methods. This runs before and after each test.

Then methods like <xref:Bunit.TestContext.RenderComponent``1(Bunit.Rendering.ComponentParameter[])> can now be called directly from each test, as seen in the listing above.
