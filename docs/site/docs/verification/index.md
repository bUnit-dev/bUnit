# Verifying Output from a Component Under Test

This section covers the different ways to verify the result of a test scenario:

- **<xref:verify-markup>:** This covers the different ways bUnit enables verification and assertions against the rendered markup from a component.
- **<xref:verify-component-state>:** This covers how to inspect an instance of the component under test.
- **<xref:semantic-html-comparison>:** This covers how to customize the semantic HTML/markup comparer included in bUnit for more stable tests.
- **<xref:async-assertion>:** This covers how to create stable tests in an asynchronous world.
