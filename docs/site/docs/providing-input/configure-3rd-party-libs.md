# Configure 3rd Party Libraries for Testing

Testing a component that is built using a 3rd party component library can require additional setup steps in each test to ensure that the 3rd party components work correctly in a test context.

For example, if a 3rd party component requires services to be registered in production code, it is likely that this is needed in a test context as well. See the <xref:inject-services> page for more info on this.

Similarly, if a root component is needed to provide cascading values to the 3rd party components, that is likely to be needed as well. For more on this, see the <xref:passing-parameters-to-components#cascading-parameters-and-cascading-values> page.

## bUnit Friendly Component Libraries

This section contains a table of 3rd party component libraries that are known for allowing their users to test their components with bUnit. If additional setup or configuration is needed, a link is provided to the component library's own documentation which shows how to test a component that uses components from the library.

> [!TIP]
> If you are a Blazor component vendor and have instructions on how to setup a bUnit test context for testing components that use your components, please add a link to your documentation and component library to the table above.
