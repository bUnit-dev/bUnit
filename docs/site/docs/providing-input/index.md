# Providing Input to a Component Under Test

This section covers the various ways to provide input to a component under test. Itâ€™s split into three sub sections:

- **<xref:passing-parameters-to-components>:** This covers passing regular parameters, child content, cascading values, event callbacks, etc. This topic is mostly relevant when writing tests in C# only.
- **<xref:inject-services>:** This covers injecting services into components under test. This topic is relevant for both Razor-based tests and C# only tests.
- **<xref:configure-3rd-party-libs>:** This covers setting up 3rd party libraries in a bUnit testing scenario so that components under test that use them can be tested easily.
