# Providing input to a component under test

This section covers the various ways to provide input to a component under test. Itâ€™s split into four sub sections:

- **<xref:passing-parameters-to-components>:** This covers passing regular parameters, child content, cascading values, event callbacks, etc.
- **<xref:inject-services>:** This covers injecting services into components under test.
- **<xref:root-render-tree>:** This covers how to modify the root render tree in which components under tests are rendered.
- **<xref:configure-3rd-party-libs>:** This covers setting up third-party libraries in a bUnit testing scenario so that components under test that use them can be tested easily.
