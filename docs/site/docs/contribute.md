There are a few ways you can help improve this library.

1. Tell me if a certain type of component/scenario is hard to test. Create an issue with a minimal example of the component and the kind of assertions you would like to perform.

2. Suggest tweaks to the library's API or assertion helpers (create issue).

3. Find a bug or mistake in the library, create an issue, or even better, send in a pull request.

4. Help with documentation and/or good examples. If you figured out a elegant way to test a scenario, share it through an issue, or add it to the samples project (pull request), or add it to the documentation (pull request).
