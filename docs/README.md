# Contributing to the Documentation

This folder contains the documentation site for bUnit.

Here is a small getting started guide for contributing to the documentation...

## Structure

1. The `site` folder contains the code for generating the documentation site, _and_ the documentation in markdown files, located in `site/docs`.
2. The `samples` folder projects for the sample code that is displayed in the documentation. It has the following projects:  
  - `samples/components`: A Blazor component library project where components under test are placed.
  - `samples/tests/mstest`: A MSTest project where MSTest test samples are placed.
  - `samples/tests/nunit`: A NUnit project where NUnit test samples are placed.
  - `samples/tests/razor`: A xUnit based test project where razor test samples are placed.
  - `samples/tests/xunit`: A xUnit project where xUnit C# only test samples are placed.
  
These sample components source files and tests source files are included in the documentation using [DocFx's Code Snippet syntax](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/spec/docfx_flavored_markdown.html?tabs=tabid-1%2Ctabid-a#code-snippet). They are created as real projects, making them runnable, which helps ensure that the code shown in the documentation pages are correct and in working order.  

## Building and Viewing Docs Locally

To build and view the documentation locally, following a few steps is required:

1. From `docs/site` run `dotnet build`. If you get warnings from running `dotnet build`, try running it again.
2. From `docs/` run `serve-docs.cmd`. This will start up a local web server, hosting the generated documentation site on http://localhost:8080, using the [`dotnet serve` tool](https://github.com/natemcmaster/dotnet-serve).
3. After changing samples from `docs/samples`, run `dotnet test`. This will compile the sample components and run the sample tests.

## Documentation Writing Rules

- All pages should have a [YAML header](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/spec/docfx_flavored_markdown.html#yaml-header) with a `UID` to make it easy to [cross reference](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/spec/docfx_flavored_markdown.html#cross-reference) between pages
- All page and code references should be created using the [`xref:UID` cross reference syntax](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/links_and_cross_references.html#using-cross-reference).
-   By default, you should include code snippets as sample files in the `samples` projects, using the [code snippet syntax](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/spec/docfx_flavored_markdown.html#code-snippet).
- All code snippets should use 2 spaces as an indention unit (1 tab = 2 spaces).
