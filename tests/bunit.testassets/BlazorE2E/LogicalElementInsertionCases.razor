<!--
    The lack of whitespace between the nested components, and the fact that PassThroughContentComponent
    renders its child content without any surrounding nodes, triggers a difficult scenario for the
    logical element insertion logic. It has to recurse upwards through the logical elements hierarchy
    to determine where to append nested component output nodes because there are no other nodes for
    the output to be inserted before.
